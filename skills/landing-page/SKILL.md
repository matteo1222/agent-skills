# Landing Page Best Practices

A guide for building landing pages that convert visitors into users/customers.

## Core Principle

> "A caveman should be able to glance at it and immediately grunt back what you offer."
> — Donald Miller

## Page Structure

### Above the Fold (First Screen)

The most critical real estate. Must answer: **What is this? Why should I care?**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Logo                        [CTA]      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│   HEADLINE (5-6 words max)              │
│   Subtitle explaining how               │
│                                         │
│   [Primary CTA Button]                  │
│                                         │
│   ┌─────────────────────────┐           │
│   │    Product Screenshot   │           │
│   │    or Demo Visual       │           │
│   └─────────────────────────┘           │
│                                         │
│   Social proof: "10,000+ users"         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Headline states the value, not the feature
- [ ] Subtitle explains how you deliver that value
- [ ] Visual shows the actual product (not stock photos)
- [ ] Single, clear CTA (one action per screen)
- [ ] Some form of social proof visible

### Below the Fold Sections

**Recommended order:**

1. **Pain/Problem** — Acknowledge the frustration
2. **Solution** — How your product solves it
3. **Features** — 3-4 key features with benefits
4. **Social Proof** — Testimonials, logos, reviews
5. **Comparison** (optional) — Why you vs alternatives
6. **Pricing** — Clear, simple, no surprises
7. **FAQ** — Handle objections
8. **Final CTA** — Repeat the main action

## Headlines That Convert

### Formula: [Outcome] + [Timeframe/Ease]

**Good:**
- "Find & Remove Duplicate Files in Minutes"
- "Ship Your App 10x Faster"
- "Never Lose a Receipt Again"

**Bad:**
- "The Ultimate Solution for Your Needs"
- "Welcome to Our Platform"
- "Powered by AI" (means nothing)

### Be Specific

| Vague ❌ | Specific ✅ |
|---------|------------|
| "Save time" | "Save 5 hours/week" |
| "Boost productivity" | "Ship 3x more features" |
| "Clean your disk" | "Reclaim 10GB+ of space" |

## CTAs (Calls to Action)

### Primary CTA
- Use action verbs: "Download", "Start Free", "Get Started"
- Add value hint: "Download Free" > "Download"
- Reduce friction: "No credit card required"

### CTA Button Design
- High contrast color (stands out from page)
- Large enough to tap on mobile
- Whitespace around it
- Only ONE primary CTA per viewport

### Examples by Product Type

| Type | Good CTA |
|------|----------|
| Free tool | "Download Free" |
| Freemium | "Start Free Trial" |
| Paid | "Buy Now — $X" |
| Waitlist | "Join Waitlist" |

## Social Proof

### Types (strongest to weakest)
1. **Logos** — "Trusted by Google, Apple, Meta"
2. **Numbers** — "50,000+ downloads"
3. **Testimonials** — Real quotes with photos
4. **Reviews** — Star ratings, app store reviews
5. **Press** — "Featured in TechCrunch"

### Make It Believable
- Real photos > stock photos
- Full names > "John D."
- Specific results > vague praise
- Odd numbers feel more real (10,847 vs 10,000)

## Trust Signals

For apps/tools, address these fears:

| Fear | Trust Signal |
|------|--------------|
| "Is it safe?" | "100% local, zero telemetry" |
| "Will I lose data?" | "Files go to Trash, fully recoverable" |
| "Is it legit?" | Security badges, press mentions |
| "Can I get refund?" | "30-day money-back guarantee" |

## Pricing Section

### Best Practices
- Lead with value, not price
- Highlight recommended plan
- Show what's included (checkmarks)
- Annual discount if applicable
- Money-back guarantee

### For Indie Products
- **Lifetime deal** works great for utilities
- Price anchor: Show competitor prices
- Keep it simple: 1-3 tiers max

## Desktop App Landing Pages

### Must-Haves
- Platform badges (Mac App Store, Windows)
- System requirements
- Screenshot of actual UI
- Download button for each platform
- Version number / changelog link

### Nice-to-Haves
- Demo video (30-60 sec)
- Before/after comparison
- File size
- "What's New" section

## Technical Implementation

### Performance
- Aim for < 3 second load time
- Optimize images (WebP, lazy load)
- Minimal JavaScript
- No heavy frameworks for simple pages

### Tools (Quick Build)
- **Carrd** — $19/yr, simple, fast
- **Framer** — More flexible, export to HTML
- **Astro** — Static site, developer-friendly
- **Next.js** — If you need dynamic features

### SEO Basics
- Descriptive `<title>` with keywords
- Meta description (150-160 chars)
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Semantic HTML (h1, h2, etc.)

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Too many CTAs** — Confuses visitors
❌ **No clear value prop** — "What does this do?"
❌ **Stock photos** — Feels generic/untrustworthy
❌ **Wall of text** — Nobody reads paragraphs
❌ **Hiding the price** — Creates friction
❌ **No mobile optimization** — 50%+ traffic is mobile
❌ **Slow load time** — Kills conversions

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Real product screenshots (not mockups)
