# Mobile Automation with agent-device

For exploration, use snapshot refs. For deterministic replay, use selectors.

## Start Here (Read This First)

Use this skill as a router, not a full manual.

1. Pick one mode:
   - Normal interaction flow
   - Debug/crash flow
   - Replay maintenance flow
2. Run one canonical flow below.
3. Open references only if blocked.

## Decision Map

- No target context yet: `devices` -> pick target -> `open`.
- Normal UI task: `open` -> `snapshot -i` -> `press/fill` -> `diff snapshot -i` -> `close`
- Debug/crash: `open <app>` -> `logs clear --restart` -> reproduce -> `logs path` -> targeted `grep`
- Replay drift: `replay -u <path>` -> verify updated selectors

## Canonical Flows

### 1) Normal Interaction Flow

```bash
agent-device open Settings --platform ios
agent-device snapshot -i
agent-device press @e3
agent-device diff snapshot -i
agent-device fill @e5 "test"
agent-device close
```

### 2) Debug/Crash Flow

```bash
agent-device open MyApp --platform ios
agent-device logs clear --restart
agent-device logs path
```

Logging is off by default. Enable only for debugging windows.
`logs clear --restart` requires an active app session (`open <app>` first).

### 3) Replay Maintenance Flow

```bash
agent-device replay -u ./session.ad
```

## Command Skeleton (Minimal)

### Session and navigation

```bash
agent-device devices
agent-device open [app|url] [url]
agent-device open [app] --relaunch
agent-device close [app]
agent-device session list
```

Use `boot` only as fallback when `open` cannot find/connect to a ready target.

### Snapshot and targeting

```bash
agent-device snapshot -i
agent-device diff snapshot -i
agent-device find "Sign In" click
agent-device press @e1
agent-device fill @e2 "text"
agent-device is visible 'id="anchor"'
```

`press` is canonical tap command; `click` is an alias.

### Utilities

```bash
agent-device appstate
agent-device clipboard read
agent-device clipboard write "token"
agent-device perf --json
agent-device push <bundle|package> <payload.json|inline-json>
agent-device get text @e1
agent-device screenshot out.png
agent-device settings permission grant notifications
agent-device settings permission reset camera
agent-device trace start
agent-device trace stop ./trace.log
```

### Batch (when sequence is already known)

```bash
agent-device batch --steps-file /tmp/batch-steps.json --json
```

### Performance Check

- Use `agent-device perf --json` (or `metrics --json`) after `open`.
- For detailed metric semantics, caveats, and interpretation guidance, see [references/perf-metrics.md](references/perf-metrics.md).

## Guardrails (High Value Only)

- Re-snapshot after UI mutations (navigation/modal/list changes).
- Prefer `snapshot -i`; scope/depth only when needed.
- Use refs for discovery, selectors for replay/assertions.
- Use `fill` for clear-then-type semantics; use `type` for focused append typing.
- iOS `appstate` is session-scoped; Android `appstate` is live foreground state.
- Clipboard helpers: `clipboard read` / `clipboard write <text>` are supported on Android and iOS simulators; iOS physical devices are not supported yet.
- iOS settings helpers are simulator-only; use `appearance light|dark|toggle` and faceid `match|nonmatch|enroll|unenroll`.
- `push` simulates notification delivery:
  - iOS simulator uses APNs-style payload JSON.
  - Android uses broadcast action + typed extras (string/boolean/number).
- Permission settings are app-scoped and require an active session app:
  `settings permission <grant|deny|reset> <camera|microphone|photos|contacts|notifications> [full|limited]`
- `full|limited` mode applies only to iOS `photos`; other targets reject mode.
- On Android, non-ASCII `fill/type` may require an ADB keyboard IME on some system images; only install IME APKs from trusted sources and verify checksum/signature.
- If using `--save-script`, prefer explicit path syntax (`--save-script=flow.ad` or `./flow.ad`).

## Security and Trust Notes

- Prefer a preinstalled `agent-device` binary over on-demand package execution.
- If install is required, pin an exact version (for example: `npx --yes agent-device@<exact-version> --help`).
- Signing/provisioning environment variables are optional, sensitive, and only for iOS physical-device setup.
- Logs/artifacts are written under `~/.agent-device`; replay scripts write to explicit paths you provide.
- Keep logging off unless debugging and use least-privilege/isolated environments for autonomous runs.

## Common Mistakes

- Mixing debug flow into normal runs (keep logs off unless debugging).
- Continuing to use stale refs after screen transitions.
- Using URL opens with Android `--activity` (unsupported combination).
- Treating `boot` as default first step instead of fallback.
